`SQL server never ceases to amaze you !`

Hello Everyone, The whole point of this blog is to just share whatever I've seen so far in being a SQL server DBA and I would say this journey is never short of adventures. Every single activity \ Issue will just remind you that SQL server is a very intricate piece of software and there are a lot of moving parts inside it and you will get a chance to understand it even more...

Personally, I believe I've been lucky to have got to work in SQL server in a very (very as in Very Very!) high volume environment, getting to work on a wide variety of High Availability and Disaster recovery solutions in an On-prem Setup.

Hoping to share and learn more about SQL server through this blog !

Cheers!
